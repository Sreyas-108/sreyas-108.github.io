I am currently pursuing MS in Computer Science and Engineering at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) (expected graduation in Mar 2024). I received my BE in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). Primarily my interests are in the fields of Software Developement and Computer Vision.

Previously, I have contributed at [HBCSE-TIFR](https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/), [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (2019 student), [GCIn](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/) (2019 mentor), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/) and [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/). I have conducted research collaborations with [Prof. Poonam Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/poonam/profile) ([ADAPT lab](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/AdvancedDataAnalyticsParallelTechnologiesLaboratory)), [Dr. Jennifer Ranjani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/jenniferranjani/profile), [Dr. Sundaresan Raman](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sundaresanraman/profile) and [Prof. R. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) ([VAL (IISc)](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/index.html)). Recently, I have collaborated with [Dr. Joost Van de Weijer](http://www.cvc.uab.es/people/joost) and [Dr. Marc Masana](https://mmasana.github.io/) ([LAMP (Computer Vision Center, Barcelona)](http://www.cvc.uab.es/lamp/)), where I worked on interpretations of catastrophic forgetting in a task incremental setup from adversarial robustness perspective.

On the personal front, I am avidly interested in travel, photography, swimming and playing keyboard. Feel free to connect with me over [email](mailto:sreyasravichandran@gmail.com)!
